My Father Name is Gamini Wattegama.He is 62 Years old.He is now a pensioner.He used to work in the police Department in Gampaha.My father is more than just a parent; he is the cornerstone of our family, the unwavering support in every storm, and the guiding force that shapes my worldview. His influence on my life transcends mere words; it's a profound impact that has shaped my character, aspirations, and values.

One of the most remarkable qualities about my father is his unyielding determination. No obstacle seems insurmountable to him. I've witnessed him tackle challenges with a resolve that's truly inspiring. His perseverance teaches me the value of grit and resilience in the face of adversity.My Father's Dream is that I become a software engineer.So I do it anyway
